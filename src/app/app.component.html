    <p>I had the opportunity to work on machine vision over a year in a research lab and working for a startup company. I developed machine vision applications using <a href="https://opencv.org" target="_blank">OpenCV</a> (the best machine vision libray). This required testing and prototyping in different OpenCV supported languages i.e. Python <i>(for prototyping)</i>, C++ <i>(for real-time apps)</i> and even on C# <a href="http://www.emgu.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">EmguCV wrapper </a><i>(to speed up deployment)</i>.  I helped in automating decision making of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDuRsJhsBzI&index=1&list=PLkw9ZPH81_mUwwA16M0-bPVHly86tCUxj" target="_blank">an autonomous colonoscopy robot</a>. Also, I made the backbone of a detection and tracking<a href="http://www.indaflow.com" target="_blank"> software application</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Moreover, I am comfortable maintaining production apps. I have successfully developed features for <b>Android</b> applications using a <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" target="_blank">successful Git branching model</a>. Some tools which helped me increase productivity and keep code base organized include Bitbucket,<a href="https://get.fabric.io" target="_blank"> Fabric</a>, Android Studio, Slack and different management tools e.g. Jira, YouTrack.
    </p>
    <p>On another note, I have been part of other successful teams. During my senior year of college, together with the honors program students, I executed a <a href="https://edventurepartners.com/peer-to-peer-challenging-extremism-winners-named-in-washington/" target="_blank">social media campaign against extremism </a>reaching the nationwide finals. Extremism is such a latent issue that cannot go unnoticed. However, I seek to help the world be a better place using my expertise as well.</p>
    <p>Bushburg was my senior capstone project and is a rural simulation role-playing game. Within the game you gather resources and complete daily quests. The purpose of the video game is to educate and promote altruism from our users. It was important to keep our gamers entertained, after all, entertainment and having fun, is the purpose of any video game.</p>
    <p>Video game development is all about user experience. If a user is not satistied with a video game, there is no need to keep using it <i>(Why would you/anyone?)</i> As a developer, I implemented <a href="https://www.icloud.com/keynote/0k9laH0dfAC5UtHhcP68tBDyA#Game_Analytics_for_Developers" target="_blank">Analytics</a> and incorporated different tools into the app to measure user experience <i>(to measure <b>fun?!</b> in this case)</i>. For example, <i>heat maps</i>, <i>funnels</i> to narrow down where user starts to disengage and <i>segmentation</i> to categorize user base.</p>
    <p>For my portfolio, I would like to bundle concepts used on some past interesting projects. All into one software application. Here in this page...</p>
